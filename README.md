# Juego-de-la-Oca
Date of the project: July 2015 <br>
<br>
This is a small project that I created during a Bachelor's course on Visual Basic.<br>
<br>
The programme presents a popular game board called el Juego de la Oca. On each turn, players must roll the die and their tokens will advance the corresponding spaces according to the score obtained. Depending on the space they land on, a specific action will occur, such as moving forward, staying in a maze, or falling into a pit. The rules of the game are specified in the code.<br>
<br>
The code is written in Gambas for Linux (similar to Visual Basic). It has comments divided by steps, but it has been a while since I last looked at the code, maybe it needs some updates that I will do at some point. <br> 
<br>
The repository includes some screenshots as a preview.
